//PURPOSE: This function simply tests the copy constructor of the slist class
//and adds 6 to a the rear of copiedList and displays the list
//PARAMETER: list passed by value becomes copiedList
void CopyTest(slist copiedList)

  cout << "Adding 6 to the rear" << endl;

}


//PURPOSE of the Program: to test the overloading operation by making a copy
// of one class
//Algorithm/Design: to test copytest first, then to continue down by creating a
// linked list and making copies
